### Research


My research is concerned with inverse problems and geometry, with tools mainly coming from (singular) microlocal analysis.
In my thesis I studied the X-ray transform in the setting of asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds, whereas more recently I have been working on inverse problems for hyperbolic equations. I am also interested in interplays between the geodesic X-ray transform on closed manifolds and higher Teichmüller theory. More recently I have been working on questions regarding the range of the X-ray transform on hyperbolic space.
