### Research


My research is mainly concerned with inverse problems and geometry, with tools coming from (singular) microlocal analysis.
In my thesis I studied the geodesic X-ray transform in the setting of asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds, which is a topic I am working on to this day. Another interest of mine are nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs and  inverse problems for them. I have also worked in connections between the geodesic X-ray transform on closed manifolds and higher Teichmüller theory.
