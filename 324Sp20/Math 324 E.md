## Quick start guide

Instructor: [Nikolas Eptaminitakis](http://sites.math.washington.edu/~neptamin/)

email: [neptamin@uw.edu](mailto:neptamin@uw.edu)

Lecture time: M-W-F 8:30-9:20 in Zoom. **Meeting ID: 419-575-495**

Office Hours: W-Th 4:00-5:00 pm in Zoom. **Meeting ID: 439-604-933**

This class is a continuation of Math 126: we will explore Multivariable Calculus deeper. There will be pictures! There will be 2 midterms and a final, and quizzes. There will also be homework due once a week. 

#### Important: If you do not have access to your UW email for whatever reason please let me know as soon as possible via Canvas or Piazza####



## Announcements

- Welcome to Math 324!

## General information about the course and Syllabus

The topics we will cover include double and triple integrals, the chain rule, directional derivatives, vector fields, line and surface integrals, the grad, curl and div operators, the divergence theorem, and Green's and Stokes' Theorems. This course is a continuation of the 12x level calculus courses, and its content partly overlaps with material covered in Math 126. \textbf{Warning: This class becomes challenging towards the end, and the last few sections assume a good understanding of the entire material covered during the quarter}. Especially if you took Math 126 recently, you might find the first couple of weeks easy to follow, but this might not be the case later.

As for prerequisites, I will assume you are comfortable with basic differentiation and integration in one variable and basic algebraic manipulations. However, you shouldn't expect to have to deal with any really complicated integration tricks and I will be reviewing past material whenever necessary.

<!--## What you need

- An internet connection, hopefully functional during the time that the class meets. If not, you can always watch the recorded lectures later.


- Access to [**Webassign**](https://www.webassign.net/washington/login.html?WebAssignUsername=neptamin&WebAssignInstitution=washington). That's where the homework is going to be collected and graded. Note that there is no class key; if you are enrolled for this class, you should be able to see it in WebAssign once you enter your UW credentials.-->




## Lectures and Office Hours


At least initially, the lectures will be delivered real time on-line through Zoom at the regular time the class meets.
You will have the opportunity to stop me and ask a question.
The lectures will also be recorded and uploaded to Canvas. 
To the best of my knowledge, Zoom does not offer an option to not record all participants' voices, so if you ask a question your voice **will** be recorded. 
However, I will be removing students' voices from the version of the lecture posted on Canvas.

Similarly, office hours will be on Zoom. Those will not be recorded. If you cannot make it to office hours you can also ask for an appointment. Bringing pets to office hours is encouraged.

For the final, you will be able to start within 2.5 hours before or after the normal starting time.
The time allocated for uploading your work will be 15 minutes.


- The exams are open book/internet. However, you are **strictly prohibited from collaborating, asking others how to do the problems or sharing the exam questions with other people, whether they are students in the class or not. The exam reflects your own work and understanding of the material.**  

- If you have a compelling, documented, and legitimate reason to miss an exam please inform the instructor as soon as possible.
