- A [list of past exams](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~aloveles/Math324Winter2012/examarchive.html), from Dr. Loveless's website.

- A [compilation of past midterm problemss](Current_material/Practice_1_midterm.pdf) with [solutions](Current_material/Practice_1_midterm_sols.pdf). This is a compilation of problems I've included in midterms in the past and it is not supposed to be appropriate for 50'. If you would like to time yourself, you should be able to do this in 65-70'.

- The [solutions of the Midterm](Exams_solutions/Midterm_solutions_flat.pdf).

- A [Practice Exam](Practice.pdf). This is not an actual exam, some problems are from exams and others are not. It is longer and many are messier than you should expect in an actual exam, but it covers the important ideas you should expect on the final. [Solutions](Exams_solutions/Practice_final_solutions_flat_W2018.pdf).
